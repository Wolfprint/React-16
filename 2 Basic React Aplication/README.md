# Initial project set up

For this tutorial to worked you have to follow this basic steps:

1. Download and install [Node JS] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download and install your favorite IDE
3. Access a comand prompt and install package "Create React App" using npm:

    ```shell
    npm install create-react-app -g
    ```

5. Move to the directory where you want to initialize your React application and run this command:

    ```shell
    cd "PATH_TO_YOUR_APPLICATION_FOLDER"
    create-react-app NAME_OF_APP
    ```

## Fenced code blocks inside ordered and unordered lists

1. This is a numbered list.
2. I'm going to include a fenced code block as part of this bullet:

    ```
    Code
    More Code
    ```

3. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:

        ```c
        printf("Hello, World!");
        ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block by **(4 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces.
   3. Also need to put a separating newline above and below the fenced block.
